# moonranger-viewer
Mesh viewer for MoonRanger. This code has its origins as the viewer component of RASM, which is described below.

# Origin
The acronym 'RASM' appears throughout the codebase. This term refers to Dr. Wettergreen's Reliable Autonomous Surface Mobility navigation framework, from which the MoonRanger software directly derives. Indeed, the majority of the algorithmic processes defined within this codebase stem directly from the original RASM implementations and may appear in the form as originally found in the 'RASM' repository. Moreover, many individuals have contributed to the codebase over the years, including David Wettergreen, Michael Furlong, Michael Wagner, Ryan McNulty, and Dom Jonak.
